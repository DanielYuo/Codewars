# Codewars
This is the collection of Codewars challenges that I completed over the time that I learn how to code in python. I do realise that sometimes my codes tend to be less effective than other more seasoned programmers, but I do inspired be one some day and I strive to get better everyday. Codewars challenges is one of the ways that I do to practise my coding skills.
